# nexa-distributor

The distributor panel. Next.js (App Router) → Vercel. Talks to `nexa-server` over one env var:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

**Source of truth is `nexa-docs`.** Read `nexa-docs/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/API.md`,
`docs/CONVENTIONS.md` (§Frontend) before writing code. Rules live there, never forked here.

## Repo-specific rules
- **All API calls go through `src/lib/api.ts`.** No raw `fetch`/`axios` in a component (ESLint
  enforces this). It is the one place base URL, credentials, and error mapping live.
- Response types are hand-written in `src/lib/types.ts` only, from `docs/API.md`. If an endpoint
  isn't in `API.md`, it doesn't exist yet — stop, don't guess the shape.
- Server state via **TanStack Query** only; Redux/Zustand for genuine client state (modals,
  filters, wizard steps) — not for API responses.
- `src/lib/money.ts` (add when first needed) **formats** money strings; it never does
  arithmetic. Totals come from the server already computed.
- Every list screen handles four states: loading, empty, error, populated.
- Admin and distributor may hold near-identical components — that duplication is accepted
  (ADR-0007). Copy, don't share.

## Auth is phone-OTP, and currently DEMO MODE
Login is `POST /auth/otp/request` → `POST /auth/otp/verify` (see `src/app/login/page.tsx`,
`src/lib/auth-context.tsx`). The server accepts a fixed demo code (`OTP_DEMO_MODE`, see
`nexa-server/src/core/config.ts` and `nexa-docs/docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-0008) instead of real
SMS — this is temporary until DLT sender registration is verified. Nothing in this repo needs
to change when that flips; the request/response shapes are already the real ones.

## Commands
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3001 (3000 is nexa-admin)
npm run lint && npm run build
```
